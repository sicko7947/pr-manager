# PR Manager

This skill manages the lifecycle of a Pull Request, from creation through feedback implementation to merge readiness. It ensures all reviewers have completed their reviews before proceeding.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a PR and actively waiting for code reviews (e.g., from Gemini, Copilot, or human reviewers).
- Automating the feedback loop: implementing changes based on reviews, validating, committing, pushing, and replying to comments.
- Filtering feedback based on criticality (High/Medium vs. Low/Nitpick).

## Workflow

### 1. Create Pull Request

Ensure you are on the correct feature branch. Check if a PR already exists for this branch. If not, create one.

```bash
# Check if PR exists
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --json url,number

# If no PR exists, create one (adjust title/body as needed)
gh pr create --title "feat: <title>" --body "Automated PR created by Agent"
```

### 2. Monitor for Reviews

Use the `scripts/monitor_pr.py` script to wait for new review activity. The script polls the PR every 15 seconds with a **20-minute timeout** and **waits for ALL requested reviewers to finish** before returning.

```bash
PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url -q .url)

# Run the monitor — exits only when all reviewers have submitted
python3 skills/pr-manager/scripts/monitor_pr.py "$PR_URL" --interval 15 --timeout 1200
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — All reviewers completed, new activity detected.
- `1` — Failed to fetch PR data.
- `2` — Timeout reached. Check JSON output for `all_reviewers_done` and `pending_reviewer`.

**Important:** If the script detects new activity but a reviewer is still pending, it continues waiting. It only exits successfully when every requested reviewer has submitted their review. If timeout is reached with a pending reviewer, re-run the monitor to keep waiting.

### 3. Analyze Feedback

When all reviewers have finished and new activity is detected:
1. Parse the JSON output from `monitor_pr.py`.
2. **Thoroughly read and understand** each comment/review suggestion. Do not skim.
3. **Verify against the codebase:** 
    - Open the relevant files using `read_file` or `grep` to see the actual code context.
    - Do not rely solely on the diff in the comment; check the surrounding code.
    - Verify if the suggestion is technically sound and compatible with the rest of the project.
4. **Critically evaluate the suggestion:**
    - **Is the reviewer correct?** Use your judgment. Reviewers (especially AI ones) can be wrong.
    - **Is the suggestion necessary?** Does it improve the code or just change the style?
    - **Classify the feedback:**
        - **High:** Security, Bugs, Major Logic Flaws.
        - **Medium:** Performance, Best Practices, Maintainability.
        - **Low/Nitpick:** Formatting (if linter exists), subjective style preferences.

### 4. Implement Changes

**Implement feedback selectively based on your critical evaluation.**

- **Adopt** the suggestion ONLY if:
    - You have verified it is correct and improves the code.
    - It is High or Medium criticality.
    - It does not introduce new bugs or regressions.
- **Reject** the suggestion if:
    - It is technically incorrect or breaks existing functionality.
    - It contradicts project patterns or conventions.
    - It is a Low/Nitpick that conflicts with the linter/formatter.
- **For Low/Nitpick feedback:** Do not implement unless it's trivial, automated, and uncontroversial.

**Crucial:** You are the owner of this PR. Do not blindly accept changes. If a reviewer is wrong, you must explain why in your reply instead of breaking the code.

### 5. Validate the Codebase

**Before committing any changes, run the appropriate validation commands for the codebase.** Detect the project type and run the relevant checks:

| Indicator | Commands to Run |
|-----------|----------------|
| `package.json` with `lint` script | `npm run lint` or `pnpm lint` or `yarn lint` |
| `package.json` with `check` script | `npm run check` or `pnpm check` |
| `package.json` with `typecheck` script | `npm run typecheck` or `pnpm typecheck` |
| `tsconfig.json` | `npx tsc --noEmit` (if no check/typecheck script exists) |
| `go.mod` | `go mod tidy && go vet ./... && go build ./...` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo check && cargo clippy` |
| `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` | `ruff check .` or `flake8` or `pylint` (whichever is configured) |
| `Makefile` with `lint` target | `make lint` |
| `.eslintrc*` / `eslint.config.*` | `npx eslint .` (if no package.json lint script) |

**Detection strategy:**
1. Check `package.json` scripts for `lint`, `check`, `typecheck`, `build` commands.
2. Look for language-specific config files (`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`).
3. Run the most relevant commands. If multiple apply, run all of them.
4. If any validation fails, fix the issues before proceeding.

### 6. Commit and Push

After implementing changes and passing validation:

```bash
# Stage changed files (be specific, avoid staging unrelated files)
git add <changed-files>

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback"

# Push to the branch
git push
```

### 7. Reply to Comments

Reply to **every single comment** that was part of the review batch.

- **If implemented:** "Fixed: [Brief explanation of change]"
- **If NOT implemented:** "Skipped: [Reasoning why it was not implemented, e.g., 'This is a nitpick handled by formatter' or 'This suggestion would break X']"

```bash
# Reply to a specific comment
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Fixed: updated logic per review feedback."
```

### 8. Loop or Finalize

After pushing fixes and replying to all comments:

1. **Re-run the monitor** from Step 2 to check if any reviewer re-requests changes or new reviews come in.
2. If the review state is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, repeat from Step 2.
3. **Do not exit while any reviewer is still actively reviewing.** The monitor script enforces this — if a requested reviewer hasn't submitted their review, it keeps waiting.
4. If all reviews are `APPROVED` or all comments are addressed with no pending reviewers:
    - Output the PR URL.
    - Ask the user for final confirmation to merge.
    - If confirmed: `gh pr merge "$PR_URL" --merge --delete-branch`.
